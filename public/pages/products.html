	    <h4 class="center-align">Why do we price our bbq pits at such low prices?</h4>

	    <p>It is a question we get often.  People are used to paying more for high end portable smokers and wonder how we can build our pits and sell them so low.</p>

	    <p>These are some of the things we do that help keep costs down.</p>

	    <p><b><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Materials:</b> We build your pits with steel plate. We do not use pipe. The plate we shear and roll to form any diameter cylinder. The plate saves money in two ways.  It costs less than pipe and it also is reduces our inventory costs, since we do not need to stock all different sizes of plate. It also eliminates the temptation of sneaking  in used pipe every now and then.... you can't buy used plate to build a smoker.</p>

      <p><b><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Manufacturing:</b> Having one welder build the entire smoker is very nice but, someone has to pay for all the waste in time and resources. That someone is you.<br>
      At Old Country the smokers are build by teams or artisans who have many years of metal working experience. Some artisans build the different components of the smokers while others welded them together.<br>
      It is over simplified here but the philosophy is to take all the care possible to build a great smoker without throwing away resources.</p>

      <p><b><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Purchasing:</b> Purchasing the materials is just as important as selling the bbq pits. We purchase the materials in bulk to reduce their cost and also we buy many of the components directly from the manufacturers.</p>

      <p><b><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Location:</b> Old Country BBQ Pits is based in Laredo Texas. This allows us to have the manufacturing facilities in Mexico. By fabricating in Mexico with a combination of American materials and Mexican labor the cost of fabricating the smokers is reduced tremendously.</p>

      <p><b><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Margin:</b> We enjoy healthy sales and we do not need to make all our profit from the one pit you buy. Just like buying in volume reduces our costs our sales level reduces our need to charge more per smoker.</p>

      <p>So, it is not one thing that we do but, a combination of many elements that help us produce at lower costs and pass those savings on to you.</p>

      <p>Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Well, that's certainly good to know. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? I am your worst nightmare! Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Computer, lights up! We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'll alert the crew. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? You enjoyed that. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. What? We're not at all alike! The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Your head is not an artifact! Wouldn't that bring about chaos? The unexpected is our normal routine. We have a saboteur aboard. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? How long can two people talk about nothing? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Sorry, Data. Talk about going nowhere fast. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Besides, you look good in a dress. Damage report! Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? and attack the Romulans. They were just sucked into space. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Computer, belay that order. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Not if I weaken first. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Travel time to the nearest starbase? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion?
