    <p>For many, many years people in Texas and Northern Mexico have gathered around camp fires. Whether they are camping, hunting, fishing or spending time with friends and family, there is something special about a camp fire that bonds people like few other things can.</p>
    <p>Traditionally the instrument of choice for a safe campfire is the outdoor fire pit also known as an outdoor fireplace. They have come in many shapes and sizes. Today one of the most popular types is the Old Country style of outdoor fire pits. There are many companies selling this style of fire pits and with good reason. This is a proven design that works.</p>
    <p>The Old Country Outdoor Fire Pits (or outdoor fireplaces) currently come in two styles; the Extended Grill Fire pit and the Double Grill fire pit.</p>
    <p>Both pits have the following features in common:</p>
		<p><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Leg extensions to bring them to waist height.</p>
		<p><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Expanded metal grill for barbequing</p>
		<p><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Angle Iron frame for the expanded metal grill</p>
		<p><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Swivel grill</p>
		<p><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Stainless steel handle</p>
		<p><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Minimum of 3/16" thick steel</p>
		<p><i class="greyred tiny material-icons">label</i> Hand Made</p>
		<p>There is another feature these fire pits share: Compared with other fire pits, the Old Country pits give you the biggest bang for the buck.</p>
