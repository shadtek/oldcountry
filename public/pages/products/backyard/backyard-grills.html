    <p>We have two styles of back yard BBQ grills, the <b>All American BBQ Smokers</b> and the <b>Old Country BBQ Pits</b>. They both produce great tasting barbeque with less effort than ordinary BBQ Smokers.<br>
    Our BBQ Smokers are designed to reduce hot and cold spots within the cooking chamber, to retain the heat, prevent smoke from leaking, have a long life and, basically, aid you to barbeque.</p>
